# import:
1. os: Accesses environment variables(like API key).
2. json: To encode/decode JSON messages for both WebSocket and Kafka.
3. asyncio: Native Python async framework.
4. websockets: async WebSocket client
5. threading: Runs task in parallel with the main program, use in websocket connection.
6. load_dotenv: Loads environment vairables from a .env file securely.
7. AIOKafkaProducer: Async Kafka producer client from aiokafka

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Reads API key
load_dotenv() -> load the .env file into environment.
os.getenv("API") -> Fetches the API key securely from environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Kafka Configuration:
KAFKA_BROKER = os.getenv("KAFKA_BROKER", "kafka:9092") -> Points to the Kafka server.
TOPIC_NAME = os.getenv("KAFKA_TOPIC", "forex_stream") -> Name of the Kafka topic where Forex messages will go.
SYMBOLS = ["OANDA:EUR_USD", "OANDA:USD_JPY", "OANDA:GBP_USD", ... ] -> Sets the currency pairs to subscribe

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Define function to subscribe and stream ticks
1. This function is to:
	- Uses the WebSocket connection (ws)
	- Subscribes to all currency pairs
	- Waits for messages from Finnhub
	- Sends each tick to Kafka
2. For each forex pair, send a subscribe command to Finnhub, Finnhub will start streaming live ticks for those symbols
	Sends a subscription message (in JSON format) for each forex pair you want to track
		- The WebSocket will then start sending live price ticks for those symbols.
		- The await allows other code to run (like handling another API call or incoming WebSocket message) while this one is waiting.
3. Starts an infinite async loop that waits for new WebSocket messages.
	"async for", it doesn’t block — it only reacts when a message arrives.
4. Parses each message into dict and only proceeds if the messgae contains "data". (since the message will contain "data" keyword)
5. "send_and_wait" is an async Kafka method:
		- Sends the message
		- Waits for acknowledgment from Kafka that it was received


# Defines an asynchronous function to handle the full lifecycle:
Creates a Kafka producer:
	- Initializes Kafka producer
	- Connects to WebSocket
	- Calls stream_ticks
	- Keeps retrying on failure

1. Connect to Kafka:
	a. Create an AIOKafkaProducer object
	b. Serialize values to JSON UTF-8 bytes: json.dumps().encode()
	c. Start kafka connection: await producer.start()

2. Retry Loop for WebSocket
	a. Tries to connect to Finnhub’s WebSocket
		- Constructs the WebSocket URI with API token
		- Establishes an asynchronous WebSocket connection to the specified uri.
		- Sends a WebSocket connection request to the server at the given uri.
		- If successful, returns a WebSocket object (ws).
		- Then use that object to send or receive message.
	b. If connection is successful, call stream_ticks(ws, producer) to start streaming
	c. If connection drops or errors out, it jumps to except
3. Catches any runtime errors

4. Cleanly shuts down the Kafka producer
